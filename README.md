# JavaSummerCamp

Day 1: Cover creating projects, packages, classes in Eclipse.

- Syntax: All code inside a method, mostly main for now. Semicolons at end of line. 
- Printing: Print out strings, small math problems. Show difference between "3" + 3 and 3 + 3, etc.
- Variables: Store and change values. =, +=, -+, etc.
- Data types: int, double, String. No bool yet. Show integer division.
- Scanners: Read/echo keyboard input.
- Methods: implement basic math methods and test use with printing
- Math operations and Math class: Show mod. (kids asked about sine/cos/tan, etc. so we showed the Math class and how to use stuff like Math.pow();

Day 2:

- boolean: show boolean type. True/false and using statements like 5 <= 3
- control statements: if, while loops reading input with scanner and responding. Play with infinite loops and printing x++ each loop. Use break in a while loop.
- small q&a program with scanner, checking input: Ask for answers to 5 questions, respond as needed. At the end, convert to a for loop.

Day 3:

- OOP: common data storage rather than player1MaxHealth, player2MaxHealth, player1CurrentHealth, etc. Have player1 and player2.
- Member variables: player.maxHealth, etc.
- Inheritance: player and enemies are a type of character superclass. Character cannot exist by itself, must always be a subclass.
- protected vs public vs private: use protected for vars, public for methods usually.
- Implement character, player, enemy, vampire together, let them develop other enemy types
- fill in GameTester class to play game on command line: help them use the classes they just made.

Day 4:

- start developing GUI for game
- window
- frame
- buttons
- panels
- updating health when healing/taking damage

Day 5:

- ActionListeners for buttons
- images
- playtesting
- help with new features as requested
